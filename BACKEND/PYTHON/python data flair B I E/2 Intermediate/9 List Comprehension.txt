12. Python List Comprehension
You can create a new list just like you would do in mathematics. 
To do so, type an expression followed by a for statement, all inside square brackets. 
You may assign it to a variable. Let’s make a list for all even numbers from 1 to 20.

>>> even=[2*i for i in range(1,11)]
>>> even
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]

Optionally, you can add an if-statement to filter out items. 
If we want to change this list to hold only those items from 1 to 20 that are even and are divisible by 3, we write the following code.

>>> even=[2*i for i in range(1,11) if i%3==0]
>>> even
[6, 12, 18]


13. Built-in List Functions
There are some built-in functions in Python that you can use on python lists.

len()		sum()
list()		max()
sorted()	min()			
any()		all()

							14. Built-in Methods

append()			insert()
remove()			pop()
clear()				index()
count()				sort()
reverse()
