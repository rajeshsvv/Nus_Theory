Sets

5. Python Set
This is one of the important Python Data Structures. 
A Python set is a slightly different concept from a list or a tuple. 
A set, in Python, is just like the mathematical set. 
It does not hold duplicate values and is unordered. However, it is not immutable, unlike a tuple.

Let’s first declare a set. Use curly braces for the same.

>>> myset={3,1,2}
>>> myset
{1, 2, 3}

As you can see, it rearranged the elements in an ascending order.

Since a set is unordered, there is no way we can use indexing to access or delete its elements. Then, to perform operations on it, Python provides us with a list of functions and methods like discard(), pop(), clear(), remove(), add(), and more. Functions like len() and max() also apply on sets.
