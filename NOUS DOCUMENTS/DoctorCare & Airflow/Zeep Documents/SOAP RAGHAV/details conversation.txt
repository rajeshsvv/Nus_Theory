convrsation 3:

Update

From these latest email attachment, following assertion can be made

?	It is going to be python library (No Java, No Node etc). There is no UI work involved.
?	There is no REST call. It will be SOAP Request with Authentication Header.
?	Based on SOAP Authentication Header, Ministry Health Website will send SOAP Response (i.e Doctor’s Data)
?	Going forward this python library will be integrated with existing Product called PracticeCare (Out of scope as per document)
?	PracticeCare is an existing Analytical product which will generate leads based on SOAP Response.


look into python, SOAP, Self-Generated Certificate, public private key terminology.
