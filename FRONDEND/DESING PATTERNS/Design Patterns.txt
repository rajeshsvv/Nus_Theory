DESIGN PATTERNS: GoF Rule(Group of Four 23 Total Design Patterns)Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems.

This course covers all the GoF design patterns. In fact, here's the full list of what is covered:

SOLID Design Principles: 
			Single Responsibility Principle, 
			Open-Closed Principle, 
			Liskov Substitution Principle, 
			Interface Segregation Principle and 			 
			Dependency Inversion Principle



Structural. 
Behavioral.

Creational Design Patterns: These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation.

Builder,
		(seperate the construction of complex object from its representation so same construction process can create different representations)
Factories (Factory Method and Abstract Factory), 
		(Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.)
		(factory method pattern uses subclass to create object of derivved class of antoher class which is not known.
		Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass.)
Prototype.
			Singleton.(only one instance can be created for class it will be available for all other applications).

Structrural Design Patterns:These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.

			Adapter, 
			Bridge, 
			Composite, 
			Decorator, 
			Façade, 	
			Flyweight 
			Proxy

Behavioral Design Patterns: 

			Chain of Responsibility, 
			Command, 
			Interpreter, 
			Iterator, 
			Mediator, 
			Memento, 
			Observer, 
			State, 	
			Strategy, 
			Template Method
			Visitor
