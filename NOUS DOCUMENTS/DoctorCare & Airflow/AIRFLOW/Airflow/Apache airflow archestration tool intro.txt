Apache Airflow is an open-source tool for orchestrating complex computational workflows and data processing pipelines. ... 
An Airflow workflow is designed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
That means, that when authoring a workflow, you should think how it could be divided into tasks which can be executed independently


Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. 
Use airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. 
The airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies.

The Airflow scheduler monitors all tasks and all DAGs, and triggers the task instances whose dependencies have been met. ... 
The Airflow scheduler is designed to run as a persistent service in an Airflow production environment. 
To kick it off, all you need to do is execute airflow scheduler .

In computer science and mathematics, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a graph that is directed and without cycles connecting the other edges. 
This means that it is impossible to traverse the entire graph starting at one edge. ... 
The graph is a topological sorting, where each node is in a certain order.
